 PRISM Scandal 

In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been collecting enormous 
amounts of communication and search data from internet companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and 
many more, including data about the activities of American citizens [27]. Snowden also explained that even 
low-level NSA employees have the ability to access this data without warrants. Such surveillance has taken 
place since January 2007. It may not be immediately clear why this information is particularly relevant to the 
cloud. The government can force cloud service providers to install backdoors in their hypervisors, but it can do 
the same for operating systems and even individual machines [11]. However, targeting the machine of one indi-
vidual is much less likely, since at that point the government has singled out that user specifically. Instead, the 
cloud provides the NSA with a brimming ocean of network activity, in which it can cast its net and hope to catch 
something of use—much more efficient than targeting individual machines. As one writer for Porticor said: 
“Scanning all the data from a cloud provider is relatively easy, because massive amounts of data from multiple 
owners is all available” [11]. Porticor recommends that users encrypt their own data to combat such invasions of 
privacy, but it is doubtful that such a solution will ever prove widely acceptable, seeing as it places undue re-
sponsibility on users and requires a degree of expertise. The example of PRISM [27] touches on many issues 
within the future of cloud security: maintenance of privacy, government policy, and data theft (since attackers 
may capture user data using NSA techniques, or even the NSA channels themselves). These issues are not often 
considered by users of cloud services, and are not being discussed on a large scale. 
6.2. A Better Cloud 
There are organizations working towards a more secure cloud, such as the CSA [2]. Another is Silver Sky, an 
expert provider of cloud security and provider of “the industry’s only advanced Security-as-a-Service platform 
from the cloud” [13] [28]. The CTO of Silver Sky, Andrew Jaquith, explains that many CIOs are moving their 
services to the cloud in order to save money, but that security remains a key concern and these moves may be 
insecure or at least hasty. But on the other hand, he also explains that many cloud service providers are becom-
ing clearer, more transparent, and more assured than ever before that they could protect customer data [13]. 
Thus, the move to the cloud, while it may in some ways be insecure, does not herald anyone’s doom. And, 
with its ever-increasing popularity, even hesitant companies may not soon have a choice. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we provide an overview of cloud security in various aspects. We first review the data storage 
scheme for Amazon’s cloud. The unique forms of products and services offered through cloud services show the 
incentive for modern business use. Using Amazon Web Services [12] as a case study, we are able to implore 
some of the basic terms and concepts of cloud computing. We then proceed to discuss data security, API con-
cerns, account hijacking, and other security concerns. These general concerns are shown to be of particular in-
terest to cloud security. The main differences between traditional services and cloud services are compared from 
a security perspective. Service and account hijacking is covered, as well as possible defenses. We investigate

differences between security issues in cloud services and in traditional services. From the practitioners’ view, we 
briefly overview the security in cloud. The study in this paper provides a guideline of research on cloud services 
and security issues. Finally, we give some ideas on how to build a more secure cloud. Our future work will focus 
on the security concerns in cloud services. It will include the privacy protection of data information stored in 
cloud, data integrity with multiple backups for services purpose, etc
