           SERVICE AND ACCOUNT HIJACKING

At this point in its development, the cloud is seriously at risk for service and account hijacking [2]. This entails 
the unauthorized access to and use of the accounts and services of clients who utilize the cloud. This hijacking 
can happen any number of ways—since the cloud is simply a network run on many different servers, it is vul-
nerable to all the same attacks as both networks and servers [2]. 
Once an attacker has hijacked a service or account, he or she may be able to eavesdrop on the activities of the 
authorized users, impersonate authorized users, tamper with the network data, or utilize the service or account to 
propagate malware, e.g. by redirecting clients to malicious websites—all the threats typical for non-cloud net-
works and servers [2]. Unique to the cloud, however, the attacker may use the hijacked service or account as a 
base of operations to perform further attacks on other machines in the cloud
